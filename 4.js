/*
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function where as a Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

Promise are preferred over callbacks because:-

* Readability and Maintainability
* Better Error Handling
* Chaining and Composition
* Avoiding Inversion of Control
