/*
The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a security measure implemented in web browsers to restrict how documents or scripts loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin. An origin is defined by the combination of the scheme (protocol), host (domain), and port number. For example:

https://example.com:80 and https://example.com:443 are considered different origins because of the port difference.
https://example.com and http://example.com are different because of the protocol difference.
